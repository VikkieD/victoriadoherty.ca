Graphic Design? Really Victoria? Why this? Also, why is the sky blue?

Well folks, design has always been apart of my life. My little self grew up in a very creative household where there was art everywhere and I was encouraged to draw and be unique.

So when I found out that I could do all that for clients and for it to have an actual purpose, well, I thought it was the most awesome of awesome sauce's out there.

I believe that all brands should have their own unique personalities and creativity behind them to make a real impact on people.

Oh and uh, maybe you should look up the sky blue thing instead.
